# Predicting Injury-Causing Road Accidents in Latvia

**Road-traffic injuries represent one of Latvia’s most pressing publics‐health challenges. Over the period 2013–2024, police records document 388 480 crashes, of which nearly 93 percent result in no personal injury—but the  remaining 7 percent (~28 000 incidents per year) inflict minor to fatal harm on drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Beyond the immediate human toll,these injury-causing collisions burden emergency services, drive up insurance payouts, and incur long-term societal costs. in this project, we pursue three intertwined goals:**
    
     
1. Predictive: Develop a machine‐learning classifier that, given the 
circumstances of a crash (driver age, time of day, alcohol 
involvement, and environmental conditions), can flag whether it will 
cause bodily injury.
2. Descriptive: Uncover latent “accident personas” via unsupervised 
clustering—identifying natural groupings such as young evening‐
alcohol incidents or senior morning commutes.
3. Prescriptive: Map geographic “hotspots” where injury-causing 
crashes concentrate, enabling targeted interventions (e.g., DUI 
checkpoints, road-surface treatments, lighting improvements).
## Value Proposition: 
These insights empower three stakeholder groups:
    • Law Enforcement can optimally time sobriety checkpoints and 
patrols when and where high-risk profiles coalesce.
    • Road Authorities can prioritize costly infrastructure upgrades—
such as improved lighting or de-icing—in the areas most prone to 
injury-causing collisions.
    • Public Health Planners can design tailored education campaigns for 
the specific driver‐time combinations that carry the greatest risk.
